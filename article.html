    <h1>“How does Creative Writing affect your personality?”</h1><br>
    <h2><i><b>By- Priyanshu Singh</b></i></h2>
    <p><b>It’s been quoted that “a pen is mightier than a sword”, and over the course of time history has evidently witnessed some of the most magnificent works in the field of literature. We know Sir Arthur Canyon Doyle, the writer who created the world famous character of Sherlock Holmes. Readers across masses were intrigued by the volumes of the books. Exotic collections of pen works like these have inspired thousands of young writers to step into the light and show themselves off. They are learning to tap into their full potential and enlarge their imaginations. People are seen trying to put a lot of thought to paint the canvas with their best colours.  Their works can be seen very often these days. You can find them on a poster in a coffee house, on different school magazines, on notice boards in subways; some of them might have caught your eye on the weeklies. The best part is that they never cease to amaze you. But ever wondered how creative writing affects you? Here’s how.</b></p>
    <p><b>Creative writing is a very rare skill which requires quite an amount of vocabulary, a vast imagination and some time to be perfected. To write a good content one must first know the context of the topic. How do these contexts originate? They are born from the writer’s imagination. Creative writing could consist of the writer’s personal experiences, feelings or thoughts on a particular element. They derive their ideas from either real life or fictional thoughts. Mind is a very powerful tool for human kind. The greater the level of interpreted thoughts, the denser is the content. To write relatable content one must dive deep into his mind and tap into a world where his pen becomes omnipotent, and when this creation of this world becomes a habit, the person’s personality starts resonating with his works. That is what one can call an “awakening”.</b></p>
    <p><b>Different writers develop different certain traits of personalities but you’ll always find them revolving around their genre of writing. For example, nowadays different anime that we watch these days are originally the work of imaginative writing. One must remember that “Words have the power to alter the reality itself.” Create your own world, let your imagination flow explore the possibilities that go beyond reality and alter it your way.</b></p>
