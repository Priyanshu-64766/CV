        I sat down one day with a restless heart<br>
        Seemed like I’m missing out on a part<br>
        A part of my soul that feels long gone<br>
        Like a darkness devouring it on and on<br>
        It’s getting hard to keep it up anymore<br>
        It feels like nothing but I’m not so sure.<br>
        <br>
        I’m trying and trying but it’s all in vain<br>
        Can’t hold it any longer against the pain<br>
        Sleepless nights and endless thoughts<br>
        Everything here has countless knots<br>
        Unconsciously trapped in my mind snares<br>
        But couldn’t scream ‘cause no one cares.<br>
        <br>
        But I often think “Hey! What goes?”<br>
        Growing up’s a pain it’s just another dose<br>
        Then I pickup myself and gather all I got<br>
        I feel better or that’s what I thought<br>
        Dragging myself through this nasty path<br>
        Knowing deep down would lead to scathe.<br>
        <br>
        I faced the outcome that I was doomed to<br>
        Was dispatched the darkness that was due<br>
        Humiliated and broken, I suffer all again<br>
        Out of breath going all insane.<br>
